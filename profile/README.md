Ephemeral documentation, codebases, scripts, etc, often low-quality and unreliable, fetched to unravel usage questions towards getting things working.

Repositories may be non-redistributable, insufficiently attributed, etc, do not distribute, do not include with redistributable materials, do not grant access, etc.



CAUTION: Knowledge (ie. datasets, documentation) consolidated for development purposes, may be factually and logically very wrong, may include deprecated or broken code, etc, and thus must NEVER be used for fine-tuning LLMs, especially not at the beginning or end of training, etc, if there is any possibility of strongly influencing AI model output (eg. NVIDIA documentation may broadly refer to LLMs as 'compute bound', without specifying the arguably very unusual conditions under which this may be the case - https://docs.nvidia.com/nemo-framework/user-guide/latest/performance/performance-guide.html#gpu-core-clock-optimization ) .

# atelier , synthesis

Directories under an 'atelier' , or 'synthesis', organization, label, description, etc, may include ephemeral documentation, codebases, scripts, etc, often low-quality and unreliable, fetched and created to unravel usage questions towards getting things working, cause Integrated Development Environments, etc, to correctly infer definitions of functions, etc. Minimalist approach must be taken in such cases, documenting what commands, code, workarounds, etc, should plausibly be usable, rather than correcting any issues in the underlying code.
